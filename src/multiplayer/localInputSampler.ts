   * `multiplayer-netcode-spec.md` §6: those four fields must never reach the
   * shared stream (locally applied or sent), or a pause/blur/pointer-unlock

   * Cheats need no equivalent handling: `consumeCheat()` is never called
   * here (nothing ever needs it — `InputSnapshot` has no cheat field at
   * all), so a typed cheat code just sits queued on this controller forever,
   * unread. That's an accurate side effect of this design, not a deliberate
   * step-8 "cheats disabled" mechanism to rely on elsewhere.
